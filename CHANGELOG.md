# Changelog

All notable changes to Dikta will be documented in this file.

## [0.3] - 2026-02-26

### Features
- Mic Distance setting (Close / Normal / Far) — configurable speech detection sensitivity to fix "No Speech" with AirPods and headsets
- Language hotkey (Cmd+Ctrl) — cycle between languages without opening the menu
- Indonesian language support
- Menu restructured: Hotkeys, Audio, Write in, Advanced sections
- "Setup..." renamed to "About..."

### Fixes
- Speech detection thresholds now dynamic instead of hardcoded (was causing false "No Speech" at normal distance)

## [0.2] - 2026-02-20

### Features
- Mute Notifications toggle in Advanced menu — suppresses routine notifications (Ready, Pasted, No Speech, etc.) while keeping error/important ones
- Mute Sounds and Mute Notifications are independent toggles

### Fixes
- AirPods Pro microphone not detected — AudioRecorder now retries when Bluetooth HFP profile switch causes a zero-sample-rate format
- AudioRecorder observes `AVAudioEngineConfigurationChange` during recording for better Bluetooth device handling
- TTS onboarding: green checkmark now only appears after the server is actually responding, not just after files are installed
- TTS error messages now distinguish "not set up" from "server still starting" when pressing the Read Aloud hotkey
- Accessibility and Microphone permission status now auto-updates in the onboarding window (polls every 5 seconds)
- Get Started button disabled while TTS installation is in progress
