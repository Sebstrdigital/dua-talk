# Changelog

All notable changes to Dikta will be documented in this file.

## [0.4] - 2026-02-26

### Features
- Menu bar language indicator — shows current language code (EN/SV/ID) next to the menu bar icon
- Start at Login toggle in Advanced menu
- Hotkey collision detection — warns when two modes share the same hotkey
- Silence auto-stop trims trailing silence before sending to Whisper for cleaner results

### Stability
- Audio feedback thread safety — engine health check now runs inside the lock-protected region
- TTS process lifecycle — checks `isRunning` before termination, reaps child processes, removes observers in `deinit`
- Safe Accessibility API casting — prevents crashes from unexpected CoreFoundation types
- Async Bluetooth audio route handling — non-blocking wait for HFP profile switch
- Audio buffer hard limit (5 minutes) — prevents unbounded memory growth on very long recordings
- HotkeyConfig `Hashable` conformance consistent with order-independent equality
- Atomic config file writes to prevent corruption on crash

### Improvements
- Model loading uses indeterminate spinner instead of fake percentage
- "No Speech" notification title changed from "Error" to "No Speech"
- Transcription timeout prevents stuck processing state
- LlamaSwift dependency removed (unused LLM pipeline cleanup)
- Unit tests for HotkeyConfig, AppConfig, and UpdateChecker (27 tests)

## [0.3] - 2026-02-26

### Features
- Mic Distance setting (Close / Normal / Far) — configurable speech detection sensitivity to fix "No Speech" with AirPods and headsets
- Language hotkey (Cmd+Ctrl) — cycle between languages without opening the menu
- Indonesian language support
- Menu restructured: Hotkeys, Audio, Write in, Advanced sections
- "Setup..." renamed to "About"

### Fixes
- Speech detection thresholds now dynamic instead of hardcoded (was causing false "No Speech" at normal distance)

## [0.2] - 2026-02-20

### Features
- Mute Notifications toggle in Advanced menu — suppresses routine notifications (Ready, Pasted, No Speech, etc.) while keeping error/important ones
- Mute Sounds and Mute Notifications are independent toggles

### Fixes
- AirPods Pro microphone not detected — AudioRecorder now retries when Bluetooth HFP profile switch causes a zero-sample-rate format
- AudioRecorder observes `AVAudioEngineConfigurationChange` during recording for better Bluetooth device handling
- TTS onboarding: green checkmark now only appears after the server is actually responding, not just after files are installed
- TTS error messages now distinguish "not set up" from "server still starting" when pressing the Read Aloud hotkey
- Accessibility and Microphone permission status now auto-updates in the onboarding window (polls every 5 seconds)
- Get Started button disabled while TTS installation is in progress
